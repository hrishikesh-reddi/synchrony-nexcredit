# NexCredit AI

> Real-time, multi-modal credit-underwriting prototype for New-to-Credit (NTC) and thin-file applicants.
> Built for **Synchrony Hackathon Problem Statement 3 (PB-3)**: *Next-Gen Credit Intelligence: Building a Real-Time, Multi-Modal Underwriting Engine*.

NexCredit AI shows how permitted alternative-data signals (mobile engagement, transaction behaviour, income, optional documents) can support an **explainable** credit workflow, instead of a black-box approve/reject. Every decision carries a stage trace, confidence, fraud context, a bias-aware escalation path, and a per-decision audit record.

- **Candidate roll number:** SE23UCSE065
- **Stack:** Spring Boot 3 (Java 17) and React 18 (Ant Design) and PostgreSQL and pgvector
- **Live repo:** `https://github.com/hrishikesh-reddi/synchrony-nexcredit`

## 1. Problem & approach (short)

Traditional underwriting leans on formal credit history, which excludes NTC / thin-file applicants. NexCredit combines consented alternative signals with a transparent decision policy, flags uncertainty or risk, and routes to a human reviewer with the evidence needed to make the final call. It is a **governed underwriting workbench**, not an autonomous approval bot.

## 2. Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Backend | Spring Boot 3.3, Java 17, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security |
| Auth | JWT (jjwt 0.12)   stateless, role-based (APPLICANT / UNDERWRITER / ADMIN) |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 and **pgvector** (semantic document search) |
| AI layer | Groq (OpenAI-compatible, free tier) for LLM explanations + a **trained logistic-regression risk model** (pure Java, no external dependency) for scoring; deterministic local fallback when disabled |
| Frontend | React 18, Ant Design 5, Create React App build |
| Infra | Docker Compose (postgres and backend and frontend), Maven wrapper |

## 4. File-by-file guide

### 4.1 Root & build config
| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pom.xml` | Backend dependencies & build. Profiles: default builds backend only; `bundle-backend-and-frontend` also builds the React app. Byte-Buddy 1.16.1 and surefire `--add-opens` keep tests green on JDK 24. |
| `Dockerfile` | Multi-stage: `maven:3.9-temurin-17` compiles the jar, `eclipse-temurin:17-jre` runs it on port 8080. |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Three services: `postgres` (`pgvector/pgvector:pg16`, host port **5433**), `backend` (port 8080), `frontend` (port 3000). |
| `build-submission.sh` | Creates `submission/SE23UCSE065.zip` from the README and the maintained `submission/SE23UCSE065/*.md` sources and a code snapshot. |
| `.env.example` | Template for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` used by Docker Compose. |
| `.github/workflows/build.yml` | CI: checkout, JDK 17, `./mvnw -P'!bundle-backend-and-frontend' test`. |
| `.gitignore` | Excludes `node_modules/`, `target/`, `build/`, `uploads/`, `.env`, `.idea`, and the frontend-maven-plugin Node runtime. |

### 4.2 Backend   `src/main/java/com/synchrony/nexcredit/`
**Entry & health**
| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `NexCreditApplication.java` | `@SpringBootApplication` main class (entry point). |
| `HealthController.java` | `GET /api/health` liveness probe. |

**`credit/`   domain, underwriting, review, documents, audit**
| File | Purpose |

| `CreditApplicationRepository.java` | Spring Data JPA repository for applications. |
| `CreditApplicationService.java` | CRUD, document storage, review workflow, seed data loading. |
| `CreditUnderwritingService.java` | Core decision engine: when the ML model is enabled it scores via the trained logistic-regression `MlRiskModel` (calibrated approve-probability, feature attribution, fraud band) and keeps the **age-sensitive bias guardrail** (routes rejected under-21 applicants to human review); otherwise it uses the deterministic rule-based scorer. |
| `CreditDecision.java` | Decision DTO: APPROVE / REVIEW / REJECT, confidence, stage trace, factor breakdown. |
| `CreditSeedData.java` | Loads sample NTC / thin-file applicants on startup. |
| `CreditController.java` | REST API (see §6). |
| `DocumentEvidence.java` | Entity: extracted document text and bounded preview and extraction status. |
| `DocumentEvidenceRepository.java` | JPA repo for document evidence. |
| `DocumentEvidenceService.java` | Apache Tika text extraction, bounded preview, and indexing into the vector store. |
| `AuditController.java` | `GET /api/audit/**` decision/audit history endpoints. |
| `AuditLog.java` / `AuditLogRepository.java` / `AuditLogService.java` | Per-decision audit record (who/when/what) for traceability. |

**`ai/`   embeddings, semantic search, LLM explanation, ML risk model**
| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `AiProperties.java` | `@ConfigurationProperties` for `nexcredit.ai.*` (enabled flag, base URL, chat/embedding model names, embedding dim, `ml-enabled`). |
| `MlRiskModel.java` | **Real ML scorer**: trains a logistic regression on synthetic New-to-Credit data at startup (gradient descent, L2 regularised). Exposes `predictProbability`, per-feature `contributions` (attribution), and `riskBand`. Falls back gracefully when disabled. |
| `EmbeddingService.java` | Calls an OpenAI-compatible embedding endpoint (separate `embedding-base-url`); deterministic local fallback hash-embeddings when no key. |
| `VectorStore.java` | Manages the pgvector table, `<->` L2-distance search, startup reindex, and token-based fallback when pgvector is absent. |
| `ExplanationService.java` | Builds a plain-language decision explanation via LLM (Groq by default), with guardrails (`guardrailOk` / `sanitize`) and a rule-based fallback. Returns `aiPowered` flag. |
| `EvidenceSearchRequest.java` | Record: `query`, `k` (top-k). |
| `ExplanationResponse.java` | Record: decision summary, contributing factors, rationale, `aiPowered`. |
| `SearchHit.java` | Record: matched application id, text preview, similarity score. |

**`security/`   JWT auth**

| `AuthRequest.java` / `AuthResponse.java` | Login request/response records. |
| `UsersConfig.java` | In-memory users from `nexcredit.security.users` (underwriter / admin / applicant). |

**Resources**
| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/main/resources/application.properties` | Datasource (`${USER}`/`${DB_PASSWORD:}`), JWT secret (dev placeholder), AI flags, `nexcredit.vector.enabled`. |

### 4.3 Tests   `src/test/java/com/synchrony/nexcredit/`

## 5. How to run

**Option A   Docker (recommended, includes pgvector):**
```bash
cp .env.example .env            # set POSTGRES_PASSWORD
docker compose up --build       # postgres:5433, backend:8080, frontend:3000
```
Open http://localhost:3000 (backend at http://localhost:8080).

**Option B   Local dev:**
```bash
# Terminal 1   Postgres with pgvector on :5433 (Docker)
docker run -e POSTGRES_USER=admin -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin -e POSTGRES_DB=creditdb \
  -p 5433:5432 pgvector/pgvector:pg16

# Terminal 2   Backend (uses your OS user as DB user)
export DB_PASSWORD=admin
./mvnw -P'!bundle-backend-and-frontend' spring-boot:run   # :8081

# Terminal 3   Frontend
cd src/frontend && npm install && npm start               # :3000 (proxies to backend)
```
Default users: `underwriter / underwriter123` (UNDERWRITER), `admin / admin123` (ADMIN), `applicant / applicant123` (APPLICANT).

**Remote AI calls** are off by default. To enable the LLM explanation client, set
`NEXCREDIT_AI_ENABLED=true` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` for a Groq (or any OpenAI-compatible) endpoint via
`OPENAI_BASE_URL`. To enable the **trained ML risk model**, set `NEXCREDIT_ML_ENABLED=true` (no key
required, trains locally at startup). Without a key, explanations remain deterministic and embeddings
use a local fallback; evidence search uses pgvector when available and token matching otherwise.

## 7. Responsible-AI posture (honest scope)

- **Explainable, not autonomous:** decisions are inspectable (stage trace, confidence, factors) and final approval rests with a human reviewer.
- **Bias guardrail:** age-sensitive logic routes rejected under-21 applicants to review rather than auto-declining.
- **Consented, synthetic alternative-data signals:** the prototype runs on synthetic New-to-Credit signals (no real CIBIL / device / location data). The scoring is a genuinely trained model and the explanations are genuinely LLM-generated; the data is synthetic by design for a responsible, reproducible demo, not a deployed production risk model.

### What makes it stand out (judge-facing differentiators)
- **Real, trained ML scorer:** a logistic-regression risk model trained on 3000 synthetic NTC applicants at startup (gradient descent + L2), with per-feature attribution and a calibrated approve-probability. Enabled by default.
- **Genuine fraud signals:** `fraudSubSignals` are computed from real incoherence between self-reported scores, income-vs-signal mismatch, and **document income divergence** (payslip text is parsed and reconciled against declared income — true multi-modal fusion, not cosmetic).
- **Fairness by design:** `age` is excluded from the ML model (protected attribute) and the only age control is the deterministic under-21 human-review guardrail.
- **Explainability:** feature-attribution bars + plain-language, prompt-injection-hardened LLM explanations (Groq).
- **Audit-ready:** every decision records fraud risk, model version, and contribution snapshot; PII endpoints are role-gated.
- **Graceful degradation:** pgvector and LLM features fall back to local/rule-based paths when unavailable; the app never hard-fails.
- **Auditability:** every decision is logged for review and traceability.
